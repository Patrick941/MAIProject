% Debugging Problems
% Author: Patrick Farmer Supervisor: Dr. Jonathon Dukes

# Demonstration

- Demonstration of tool in work
- Show the problems it generates
- Show an example of debugging (maybe)

# LLM's

- What LLMs are good at
  - Writing human-like code
- What LLMs are bad at
  - Creating bugs intentionally
- Interacting with LLM in code

---

# Debugging Importance

- Percentage of time debugging
- Cost of debugging late vs early in production
- Increased importance of debugging with LLMs

---

# Skills for Debugging

- Understanding the language + problem
- Using debugging tools
- Previous experience with bugs

---

# Addressing Debugging

- Greater exposure to python from program + practice understanding problems
- Future front end should include debugging tools
- More exposure to bugs particularly in LLMs

---

# Code Architecture

- Diagram of code blocks (More granular than just classes)

---

# Bug Insertion

- How bugs are inserted
- Common issues with insertion and workarounds implemented

---

# Self Checking and Improvement

- How self checking is implemented
- How the problematic responses are improved

---

# Performance across models

- Comparison of performance across models with graph
- Discussion of reasoning vs normal models

---

# Conclusion

- Summary of project
- Future work
- Questions
- Thank you
