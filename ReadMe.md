# Debugging Problems
## Project Description
It is argued that the advent of coding assistants like GitHub Copilot and Amazon
CodeWhisperer will require educators to place more emphasis on skills related to code
comprehension, testing and debugging. This project will develop a prototype educational tool
to automatically generate code debugging problems (exercises or tasks) for students to solve.
The project itself might make use of generative AI techniques to generate diverse problems
but will also use other approaches, for example, to constrain the generated problems to a
level appropriate for each learner and to focus on specific faults.
